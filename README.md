# sam
The **s**ystem **a**nalysis **m**odule is a collection of tools to integrate ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and to
analyze the resulting time series data.

# Planned features
- generic wrapper for system of coupled differential equations and networks of these
- some generic observers for the systems
- command line argument parser
- Fourier transformation
- Kernel estimation
